        How do your son/daughter's performance stack up against their fellow
        Jambites? Find out if they are racing ahead or falling behind—in under
        180 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a parent, I understand that you want the best for your child's
        education, and part of that is ensuring they are adequately prepared for
        important exams such as the UTME. Writing mock exams can help your child
        in several ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        But first let me tell you a story about how 120 JAMBITES took advantage

        may not be impacted...
